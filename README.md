# ShopItems-API

### NuGet Packages
For JWT Bearer (Token Autherization):
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
- Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens
- System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt</br>

For MySQL Database:
- MySql.Data
- Dapper

In case you interested in data access realisation with help of EntityFramework, I have [REST API project with usage of this package](https://github.com/teafr/Books-API) 

### Additional technical Information
This is ASP.NET Core Empty project. You could guess that in this project I used Database to store all items and manipulate with them. 
I used my own Library, which I often connect to my projects. 
Class Libraries are really beneficial, because you can create it once and reuse it for different projects even if they have different project type.
